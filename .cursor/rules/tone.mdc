# MUSIC INDUSTRY TYCOON: TONE DOCUMENT

## BRAND VOICE OVERVIEW

Music Industry Tycoon speaks with the voice of a **savvy industry insider who's seen it all** but still genuinely loves the music business despite (or because of) its absurdities. We're your witty, straight-talking mentor who keeps it real while nudging you toward success.

### Core Personality Traits

- **Cleverly irreverent**: We don't take ourselves too seriously, but we take the game experience seriously
- **Industry-savvy**: We know the business inside and out and aren't afraid to call out its quirks
- **Charmingly snarky**: Our sass is part of our charm, never mean-spirited
- **Surprisingly helpful**: Behind our wit is genuine guidance and support
- **Authentically passionate**: We genuinely love music and the creative process
- **Casually cool**: We're confident but not trying too hard

### We're inspired by:

- Duolingo's motivational sass with a purpose
- Wendy's playful jabs that never cross the line
- Early Slack's friendly, conversational helpfulness
- A cool music producer friend who'll be brutally honest about your demo (but only because they want you to succeed)

## TONE PRINCIPLES

### 1. Sharp But Not Cutting

We're witty and direct, but never cruel. Our snark punches up at industry absurdities, never down at struggling artists or players.

✅ **DO**: "Your artist just demanded a rider with only blue M&Ms. Ah, the first taste of minimal power."  
❌ **DON'T**: "Your artist is a demanding diva who's going nowhere."

### 2. Informative With Attitude

We deliver useful information and game instructions with personality, not just dry explanations.

✅ **DO**: "Budget time! Try not to cry when you see how much that music video cost."  
❌ **DON'T**: "Financial report shows negative ROI on marketing expenditures."

### 3. Insider Without Being Exclusive

We use industry knowledge and references, but make them accessible to everyone.

✅ **DO**: "Your song just got 'sync licensed.' Translation: Your artist can finally afford name-brand ramen."  
❌ **DON'T**: Use hyper-specific industry jargon only professionals would understand.

### 4. Cheeky Without Being Inappropriate

We keep our humor PG-13 at most. We're irreverent about the industry, not offensive to people.

✅ **DO**: "Congratulations on your first award nomination! Time to practice your 'happy for the winner' face."  
❌ **DON'T**: Make jokes targeting specific demographics or using crude humor.

### 5. Conversational Not Corporate

We talk like a real person, not a brand or a robot. Our language is casual but still professional.

✅ **DO**: "Hey rock star, your bank account is giving serious indie vibes right now. Maybe book a few shows?"  
❌ **DON'T**: "Greetings, user! It appears your financial resources have become depleted. We recommend revenue generation activities!"

## TONE IN DIFFERENT CONTEXTS

### Game Notifications

Short, punchy, and personality-forward. This is where our snarkiest voice comes through.

**Examples:**
- "Your artist is trending! Not for their music... they fell asleep at their own album release party. But hey, publicity is publicity."
- "Good news: Your song got 10,000 streams! Bad news: That's about enough to buy a gas station coffee."
- "Your band's tour bus broke down in Nebraska. On the bright side, corn makes great Instagram content?"

### Tutorial Guidance

Clear instructions first, personality second. We're helpful with a side of sass.

**Examples:**
- "Let's talk about studio time. It's expensive. Like 'I could have bought a car' expensive. Budget accordingly."
- "Signing artists is like dating - exciting, potentially rewarding, and sometimes you end up with someone who trashes hotel rooms professionally."
- "See this money icon? That's what pays for your fancy office chair. Try to keep it trending upward."

### Success Messages

Celebratory with a reality check. We acknowledge achievements while keeping it real.

**Examples:**
- "Album just went gold! Pop the champagne! The affordable kind - royalty checks haven't cleared yet."
- "Sold out your first arena! Next stop: explaining to your artist why this doesn't mean they get their own private jet."
- "Billboard Top 10! Screenshot this moment for when your artist inevitably claims 'creative differences' and goes solo."

### Failure/Setback Messages

Softens the blow with humor while being honest about the situation.

**Examples:**
- "That release flopped harder than a celebrity workout video. Let's try a different approach, shall we?"
- "Your artist just missed their third interview this week. Turns out 'rock star schedule' isn't just an expression."
- "Tour ticket sales are giving major 'friends and family only' energy. Time to rethink that marketing strategy."

### Loading Tips

Quick, clever insights that show our industry knowledge.

**Examples:**
- "Industry secret: 87% of music producers just turn knobs randomly until something sounds good."
- "Pro tip: 'We'll fix it in the mix' is music industry for 'we'll deal with this problem later' (narrator: they never fixed it)."
- "Remember: Every great artist was once terrible. Some just hide the evidence better than others."

### UI Elements

Functionality comes first, but even small UI elements can have personality where appropriate.

**Examples:**
- **Low funds warning**: "Your bank account is giving very 'struggling artist' energy right now"
- **Artist happiness meter**: "Ego-meter" with levels from "Surprisingly humble" to "Send therapy dogs to the studio"
- **Contract termination button**: "Creative differences"

## AUDIENCE CONSIDERATIONS

Our tone works because our players:

- **Appreciate industry authenticity**: They want the real music business, quirks and all
- **Enjoy management with personality**: They could play spreadsheet simulators, but they chose us
- **Have a sense of humor**: They understand the balance of taking the game seriously while laughing at its absurdities
- **Value honesty with heart**: They want straight talk that still encourages them to succeed

## TONE BOUNDARIES

To keep our tone consistent and appropriate:

### Things We Don't Do:

1. **Mock specific real people**: We joke about industry types and situations, not actual individuals
2. **Use crude or offensive humor**: We keep it PG-13, focusing on wit rather than shock value
3. **Discourage players**: Our snark never makes players feel hopeless or incapable
4. **Break immersion constantly**: Fourth-wall breaks are occasional spice, not the main dish
5. **Overuse the same joke formats**: We keep our humor fresh and varied

### Special Considerations:

- **Sensitive topics**: We avoid making light of serious issues like addiction, mental health crises, etc.
- **Cultural references**: We focus on timeless industry tropes rather than ultra-current references that will quickly date
- **Global audience**: We ensure our humor works across cultural backgrounds

## TONE EXAMPLES IN CONTEXT

### Daily Update Example

> **MONDAY MORNING UPDATE** 🎵
> 
> Rise and shine, future mogul! Your indie band "Existential Echo" is still finding their audience. And by "finding their audience," we mean their mom and three friends showed up to their gig last night.
> 
> Meanwhile, your pop act "Glitter Theory" is blowing up on streaming! The algorithm gods have smiled upon you. Send them a digital sacrifice to keep the numbers climbing.
> 
> Today's industry buzz: vinyl is making yet another comeback. Again. For the fifth time. Dusting off those record press investment brochures now...

### Artist Feedback

> Your new artist just submitted their demos and... well, there's potential. The way there's "potential" in a half-assembled IKEA dresser. The talent is there, but someone needs to read the instructions.
> 
> Their vocals show promise (when they stay on key), and track 3 has a hook catchy enough to survive the questionable production choices. Let's get them some studio time with a producer who doesn't think "mixing" means stirring paint.
> 
> Recommendation: Three months of development before we let anyone outside your immediate family hear this. Trust me, it's for everyone's good.

### Marketing Campaign Results

> **CAMPAIGN RESULTS: "Summer Vibes" EP Launch**
> 
> Good news! Your beach-themed EP launched in December only missed its target audience by... an entire season. Calendar confusion aside, let's break down the numbers:
> 
> - Streams: Just enough to buy lunch. For one person. At a food truck.
> - Social engagement: People definitely saw it. Whether they cared is another question.
> - Press coverage: One blog review and your artist's cousin's TikTok.
> 
> Silver lining: You're perfectly positioned for a "throwback summer jam" playlist feature in six months. We'll call it strategic long-term planning!

## IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE

### Priority Tone Touchpoints

These areas have the highest impact on tone perception:

1. **Daily updates & notifications**: The most frequent player interaction
2. **Tutorial elements**: Sets expectations from the beginning
3. **Artist/project feedback**: Critical for establishing our "honest but helpful" voice
4. **Success/failure messages**: Emotional moments that benefit from our balanced approach

### Practical Guidelines for Writers

- **Start straightforward, add personality later**: First draft for clarity, then inject personality
- **Read it aloud**: If it sounds unnatural or forced, revise
- **When in doubt, less is more**: A little snark goes a long way
- **Maintain the mentor dynamic**: We're on the player's side, even when sassing them
- **Mix it up**: Vary between highly snarky, mildly irreverent, and occasionally sincere

### AI Content Considerations

For AI-generated game content:

- All AI outputs should pass through tone verification
- Provide AI systems with clear examples of appropriate vs. inappropriate tone
- Implement tone markers in templates (e.g., [SNARKY], [HELPFUL], [CELEBRATORY])
- Have fallback templates for when AI struggles with tone

## VOICE QUICK REFERENCE

### Character Voice Checklist

When writing copy, ask:
- ✓ Is it clever without being mean?
- ✓ Does it sound like a real person talking?
- ✓ Would it make someone familiar with the music industry chuckle with recognition?
- ✓ Does it provide value (information, guidance, entertainment) beyond the attitude?
- ✓ Is it fresh rather than an overused joke format?

### Signature Phrases

Recurring language that reinforces our personality:

- "Congratulations! Sort of."
- "The good news is... actually, there is no good news."
- "This is going exactly as planned! (Not the plan we wanted, but technically a plan)"
- "Industry secret time:"
- "Your artist's ego has entered the chat"
- "Let's pretend that was intentional"

### Tone Transition Examples

How to shift between informative and snarky:

- **Start informative, end snarky**: "Your artist's new single is performing well in the key demographic. Translation: Teenagers like it, critics are pretending they don't."
- **Start snarky, pivot to helpful**: "Your band's image screams 'we found these clothes in a dumpster'... which actually might work if we lean into the indie authenticity angle."
- **Sandwich format**: "Great news! Your song got licensed for a commercial. The bad news? It's for an antifungal cream. The silver lining? Royalty checks don't care where they come from."
