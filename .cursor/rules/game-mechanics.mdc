## 1. CORE MECHANICS OVERVIEW

This document focuses exclusively on the functional mechanics, formulas, and systems that power the Music Industry Tycoon game. It serves as the technical blueprint for implementing gameplay systems, economic balance, and progression mechanics.

---

## 2. ARTIST MECHANICS

### 2.1 Artist Attribute System

#### 2.1.1 Primary Attributes
All attributes are on a 0-100 scale unless otherwise noted.

| Attribute | Description | Effect Formula | Decay Rate |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|------------|
| Talent | Natural musical ability | +0.5% per point to song quality | None |
| Charisma | Audience connection | +0.4% per point to live performance | None |
| Resilience | Handling pressure | Reduces burnout chance by 0.8% per point | None |
| Creativity | Innovative ideas | +0.6% per point to originality score | None |
| Discipline | Work ethic | +0.7% per point to practice effectiveness | None |

#### 2.1.2 Skill Attributes
Skills improve through practice and experience.

| Skill | Description | Improvement Formula | Max Value |
|-------|-------------|---------------------|-----------|
| Vocal | Singing ability | Base + (Practice Hours × Talent × 0.01) | 100 |
| Instrumental | Playing instruments | Base + (Practice Hours × Talent × 0.008) | 100 |
| Songwriting | Creating music | Base + (Songs Written × 0.5) + (Creativity × 0.1) | 100 |
| Performance | Stage presence | Base + (Shows Performed × 0.3) + (Charisma × 0.05) | 100 |
| Media | Interview/PR skills | Base + (Media Events × 0.4) + (Charisma × 0.03) | 100 |

#### 2.1.3 Energy System
```
Max Energy = 100 + (Resilience × 0.5) + (Level × 5)
Recovery Rate = 4 + (Resilience × 0.05) points per hour
Energy Usage:
- Practice: 10-25 points
- Recording: 15-40 points
- Performance: 20-60 points
- Media: 5-20 points
- Travel: 5-15 points per journey

Burnout Risk occurs when average daily energy is <20% for 3+ consecutive days
Burnout Effect: -50% energy recovery for 72 hours, -10 temporary penalty to all skills
```

#### 2.1.4 Career Level System

| Level | Name | XP Required | Benefits |
|-------|------|-------------|----------|
| 1 | Unknown | 0 | Base stats |
| 2 | Local Act | 500 | +5 max energy, +2% fan retention |
| 3 | Regional Talent | 2,000 | +5 max energy, +3% performance quality |
| 4 | Rising Star | 5,000 | +5 max energy, +3% recording quality |
| 5 | Established Artist | 10,000 | +5 max energy, +5% revenue from all sources |
| 6 | Mainstream Success | 20,000 | +5 max energy, +4% fan acquisition rate |
| 7 | Industry Star | 35,000 | +5 max energy, +6% collaboration quality |
| 8 | Superstar | 60,000 | +5 max energy, +8% ticket sales |
| 9 | Icon | 100,000 | +5 max energy, +10% merchandise revenue |
| 10 | Legend | 150,000 | +5 max energy, +15% legacy value |

XP is earned through all activities: recording (5-20 XP), performing (10-50 XP), media (5-15 XP), and fan growth (1 XP per 10 new fans)

### 2.2 Artist Generation Mechanics

#### 2.2.1 Procedural Artist Creation
New artists are generated using weighted distribution tables:

```
Primary Attributes: Normal distribution with mean=50, SD=15
Starting Skills: Normal distribution with mean=30, SD=10, modified by primary attributes
Character Traits: Randomly selected 3-5 traits from trait pool, weighted by genre
```

#### 2.2.2 Artist Personality System
Each artist has:
- 3-5 personality traits from a pool of 30 possible traits
- Each trait modifies behavior with specific percentage effects:
  - Perfectionist: +15% quality, -20% production speed
  - Impulsive: -10% quality, +15% production speed
  - Collaborative: +20% quality on team projects, -5% on solo work
  - Introverted: -15% media effectiveness, +10% creativity
  - Etc.

#### 2.2.3 Artist Compatibility
When artists work together, compatibility is calculated:
```
Base Compatibility = 50%
For each matching genre affinity: +10%
For each complementary trait: +5%
For each conflicting trait: -10%
Prior successful collaborations: +5% each (max +25%)
```

Compatibility affects:
- Collaboration quality: multiplied by (Compatibility ÷ 100)
- Conflict chance: (100 - Compatibility) × 0.2% per day working together
- Collaboration willingness: Won't collaborate if below 40%

### 2.3 Artist Behavior System

#### 2.3.1 Satisfaction Metrics
Artist satisfaction is calculated on a 0-100 scale:
```
Base Satisfaction = 70
Career Progress Factor = (Current XP ÷ XP for next level) × 10
Financial Factor = (Monthly Income ÷ Expected Income for Level) × 10
Creative Freedom Factor = 0-10 based on contract restrictions
Management Attention = -5 to +5 based on daily interaction frequency
Success Gap = -20 to +10 comparing to peers at similar career stage
```

Total Satisfaction = Sum of all factors, clamped to 0-100

#### 2.3.2 Behavior Consequences
Based on satisfaction level:
- 80-100: Increased productivity (+15%), loyalty bonuses
- 60-79: Normal behavior
- 40-59: Occasional difficult requests, small productivity penalty (-5%)
- 20-39: Significant issues, may threaten to leave, major penalty (-15%)
- 0-19: Contract breach risk, severe productivity penalty (-30%)

#### 2.3.3 Career Decisions
At specific career milestones, artists may:
- Request genre shifts (based on market trends and artist traits)
- Demand contract renegotiation (based on success vs. peers)
- Propose side projects (based on creativity trait)
- Consider retirement (age and satisfaction factors)

Decision probability formula:
```
Probability = Base Chance + (Trait Modifiers) + (Satisfaction Factor) + (Career Stage Multiplier)
```

### 2.4 Artist Progression System

#### 2.4.1 Skill Improvement Rates
Daily practice yields:
```
Skill Gain = Base Rate × (1 + (Discipline ÷ 100)) × Practice Duration × Quality Multiplier
```
Where:
- Base Rate = 0.2-0.5 points per hour depending on skill
- Quality Multiplier = 0.5-1.5 based on practice method and facilities
- Diminishing returns apply above skill level 70

#### 2.4.2 Popularity Growth
Popularity (0-100 scale) changes based on:
```
Daily Change = Base Change + Activity Bonuses + Trend Alignment - Decay

Where:
- Base Change = 0 (popularity naturally decays without activity)
- Activity Bonuses = Sum of all promotional activities and releases
- Trend Alignment = -2 to +2 based on genre trend fit
- Decay = Current Popularity × 0.005 (0.5% daily decay)
```

#### 2.4.3 Fan Acquisition
```
New Fans = Base Acquisition × Popularity Multiplier × Activity Reach × Conversion Rate

Where:
- Base Acquisition varies by activity type
- Popularity Multiplier = Current Popularity ÷ 50
- Activity Reach = audience size for the specific activity
- Conversion Rate = 0.5% - 5% depending on activity quality
```

Fan retention has a base 92% monthly rate, modified by engagement activities

## 3. MUSIC CREATION MECHANICS

### 3.1 Song Creation System

#### 3.1.1 Song Quality Calculation
Each song has a quality score (0-100):
```
Base Quality = 
  (Songwriting Skill × 0.4) + 
  (Relevant Instrument/Vocal Skill × 0.3) + 
  (Creativity × 0.2) + 
  (Studio Quality × 0.1)

Modifier Factors:
- Artist Energy: -20% to +10% based on current energy
- Inspiration: -10% to +20% random factor
- Producer Effect: -10% to +30% based on producer skill
- Equipment Quality: -5% to +15% based on studio tier
- Genre Alignment: -15% to +15% based on artist genre match

Final Quality = Base Quality × Average of all Modifiers
```

#### 3.1.2 Song Attributes Generation
Each song receives attributes that affect reception:
```
- Style: Primary genre + up to 2 influence genres
- Lyrics: Topic selected from 20+ themes, matched with artist traits
- Mood: 5-point scale from Melancholy to Upbeat
- Tempo: 5-point scale from Very Slow to Very Fast
- Complexity: 5-point scale from Simple to Experimental
- Production: 5-point scale from Raw to Polished
```

These attributes determine audience fit and critic reception but don't directly affect quality

#### 3.1.3 Song Creation Time
```
Base Time = 3 days
Skill Factor = Base Time × (1 - (Average Skill ÷ 200)) (max 50% reduction)
Complexity Factor = 0.8 to 1.5× based on song complexity
Studio Efficiency = 0.7 to 1.2× based on studio quality

Total Time = Base Time × Skill Factor × Complexity Factor × Studio Efficiency
```

#### 3.1.4 Song Production Cost
```
Base Cost = $300
Studio Tier Cost = Base Cost × Studio Tier Multiplier (1× to 5×)
Session Musician Cost = $100 per musician (if needed)
Producer Cost = $200 to $5,000 based on producer level
Post-Production = Base Cost × 0.5

Total Cost = Studio Cost + Session Musicians + Producer + Post-Production
```

### 3.2 Album Production System

#### 3.2.1 Album Cohesion Mechanics
Album cohesion score (0-100) affects critical reception:
```
Base Cohesion = 50
Style Consistency = +0 to +20 based on song style similarity
Thematic Consistency = +0 to +15 based on lyrical theme alignment
Quality Consistency = +0 to +15 based on quality standard deviation
Intentional Variety = +0 to +10 based on complementary diversity

Final Cohesion = Base Cohesion + All Modifiers, capped at 100
```

#### 3.2.2 Album Types & Requirements

| Album Type | Song Count | Min. Quality | Time Required | Cohesion Bonus |
|------------|------------|--------------|---------------|----------------|
| EP | 4-6 | 60 | Base + 7 days | +5 |
| Standard | 8-12 | 65 | Base + 14 days | +0 |
| Concept | 8-14 | 70 | Base + 21 days | +15 |
| Double | 16-24 | 65 | Base + 30 days | -5 |
| Live | 8-16 | 55 | Base + 10 days | +10 |
| Compilation | 10-20 | Any | Base + 5 days | -10 |

Where Base Time is the sum of all song creation times

#### 3.2.3 Album Quality Calculation
```
Raw Album Quality = Average of all song qualities
Cohesion Bonus = (Album Cohesion - 50) × 0.2
Standout Track Bonus = (Best Song Quality - Raw Album Quality) × 0.1
Filler Penalty = (Raw Album Quality - Worst Song Quality) × 0.05

Final Album Quality = Raw Album Quality + Cohesion Bonus + Standout Bonus - Filler Penalty
```

#### 3.2.4 Album Production Cost
```
Base Production = Sum of all song production costs
Mastering = $500 to $2,000 based on quality tier
Artwork = $300 to $3,000 based on quality tier
Packaging (physical) = $2 to $10 per unit based on package type
Digital Distribution = $50 base fee + 3% of digital revenue

Total Cost = Base Production + Mastering + Artwork + (Physical Units × Packaging) + Distribution
```

### 3.3 Music Reception System

#### 3.3.1 Critical Reception Mechanics
Critics rate music on a 0-10 scale:
```
Base Score = (Song/Album Quality ÷ 10)
Genre Bias = -1 to +1 based on critic's genre preferences
Novelty Factor = -0.5 to +1 based on uniqueness in market
Artist Reputation = -0.5 to +1 based on previous work
Technical Execution = -0.5 to +0.5 based on production quality

Final Score = Base Score + Genre Bias + Novelty + Reputation + Technical, clamped to 0-10
```

#### 3.3.2 Commercial Success Calculation
```
Base Units = 100 × (Artist Level + 1)
Quality Multiplier = Song/Album Quality ÷ 50 (1.0-2.0 range)
Promotion Multiplier = 1.0 + (0.1 × Promotion Level) (1.0-2.5 range)
Market Fit = 0.5 to 1.5 based on genre trend alignment
Platform Optimization = 0.8 to 1.2 based on release strategy

First Week Sales = Base Units × Quality Multiplier × Promotion × Market Fit × Platform Optimization
```

Streaming follows a decay curve:
```
Week N streams = First Week Streams × 0.7^(N-1)
```

#### 3.3.3 Fan Response Segmentation
Fan response is calculated for 5 different demographic segments:
```
Segment Alignment = -50 to +50 based on how well music matches segment preferences
Response Score = (Music Quality × 0.6) + (Segment Alignment × 0.4)
Conversion Rate = Response Score ÷ 200 (maximum 25% conversion to fans)
```

#### 3.3.4 Long-term Performance Mechanics
```
Catalog Value = Initial Value × (0.8 + (Quality ÷ 500))^Years
Where Initial Value decays at a slower rate for higher quality music

Surprise Resurgence Chance = 0.1% per month × Quality ÷ 20
Resurgence Multiplier = 3x to 10x normal streams for 2-8 weeks
```
