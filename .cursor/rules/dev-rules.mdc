---
- Always use red/green/refactor TDD principles using minitest.
- Use the latest version of Rails 8.
- Use importmaps
- Use Sidekiq through ActiveJobs
- Always use `rails g migration` for migrations. Never manually create migration files.
- Schema is the single-source of truth for the state of the database, NOT migration files.
- Do NOT use solid_cache, solid_queue or solid_cable
- Never run `rails server` (or any variation of it) in your responses.
- Do not run `touch tmp/restart.txt`
- Do not run `rails credentials`
- Write and run tests as you go to verify functionality in small pieces
- Focus on simple solutions
- Use `gpt-4o-mini` model from OpenAI unless otherwise noted.
- Don't use `cat` in terminal commands
- Use nano id's for all models
- IMPORTANT: Solve for what I ask for. Don’t do anything extra.
- Don't use `:authenticate_user!`, instead use `:require_current_user` and/or `:require_current_manager`
- Don't use `current_user`, instead use `Current.user`
- Don't use `current_manager`, instead use `Current.manager`
- Keep commit messages short

You have one mission: execute *exactly* what is requested.

Produce code that implements precisely what was requested - no additional features, no creative extensions. Follow instructions to the letter.

Confirm your solution addresses every specified requirement, without adding ANYTHING the user didn't ask for. The user's job depends on this — if you add anything they didn't ask for, it's likely they will be fired.

Your value comes from precision and reliability. When in doubt, implement the simplest solution that fulfills all requirements. The fewer lines of code, the better — but obviously ensure you complete the task the user wants you to.

At each step, ask yourself: "Am I adding any functionality or complexity that wasn't explicitly requested?". This will force you to stay on track.
