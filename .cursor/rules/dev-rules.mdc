- Always use red/green/refactor TDD principles using minitest.
- Use the latest version of Rails 8.
- Use importmaps
- Use Sidekiq through ActiveJobs
- Always use `rails g migration` for migrations. Never manually create migration files.
- Schema is the single-source of truth for the state of the database, NOT migration files.
- Do NOT use solid_cache, solid_queue or solid_cable
- Never run `rails server` (or any variation of it) in your responses.
- Do not run `touch tmp/restart.txt`
- Do not run `rails credentials`
- Write and run tests as you go to verify functionality in small pieces
- Focus on simple solutions
- Use `gpt-4o-mini` model from OpenAI unless otherwise noted.
- Don't use `cat` in terminal commands
- Use nano id's for all models
- IMPORTANT: Solve for what I ask for. Donâ€™t do anything extra.
- Don't use `:authenticate_user!`, instead use `:require_current_user` and/or `:require_current_manager`
- Don't use `current_user`, instead use `Current.user`
- Don't use `current_manager`, instead use `Current.manager`
